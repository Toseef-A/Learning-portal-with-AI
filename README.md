This was made for a challenge from a hackathon run by Microsoft. The purpose is to create a website with AI so it can help students in learning. The objective of this project was to create a learning portal with lots of different ways for students to learn and the AI will help customize their experience depending on what they like and what works for them. (Currently the API key doesnt work).
